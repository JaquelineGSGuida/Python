This parcel is mainly a study of conditional deviations.



- **Bhaskara** - From three input variables, utilizes Bhaskara’s formula to calculate the roots. Informing what they are or if they are not real numbers;
- **Buzz** - If the input number is divisible by 5, it returns the word “Buzz”. If it is not, the output is the number itself; 
- **Fizz** - If the input number is divisible by 5, it returns the word “Buzz”. If it is not, the output is the number itself;
- **Fizzbuzz** - If the input number is divisible by 3 and 5, it returns the word “Fizzbuzz”. If it is not, the output is the number itself;
- **Ordination** - From the input of three numbers, indicates if they are in crescent order;
- **Parity** - Indicates if the input number is even or odd;
- **Vertices** - Utilizes the input localization of two cartesian plane vertices to determine whether they are distant.
