This Project is more complex and more extensive than the previous ones. It is about a game called **NIM**. 

The original NIM is played between two players in person, with n pieces on a table or a board. The rules are:

- The players alternate turns;

- In each turn, the player must take out one to m pieces, being m defined in an agreement;

- The one who takes out the last pieces wins the game.

  

The project aims to simulate three sequential games between the player and a computer. However, it used a strategy that guarantees that the computer always wins: With n (number of game pieces) and m (maximum of pieces to be taken out per turn) being defined by the player, the computer defines who starts the game. Besides, when possible, the computer takes out the exact number of pieces to leave multiples of (m + 1).
