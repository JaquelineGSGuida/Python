Here are some simple programs that I developed at the beginning of my learning of Python:



- **Tens** - Finds the tens of any input integer;
- **Billing** - Practice of input and output, simulating a consultation of a payment bill; 
- **Average** - Calculates the arithmetic average of four input grades;
- **Square** - Returns the perimeter and the area of a square, utilizing the input of its side measure;
- **Seconds** - Converts seconds into days, hours, and minutes.
